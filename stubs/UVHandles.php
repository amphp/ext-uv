/**
 * Poll handles are used to watch file descriptors for readability, writability
 * and disconnection similar to the purpose of poll(2).
 *
 * The purpose of poll handles is to enable integrating external libraries that rely on
 * the event loop to signal it about the socket status changes, like c-ares or libssh2.
 * Using `UVPoll` for any other purpose is not recommended; `UVTcp`, `UVUdp`, etc.
 * provide an implementation that is faster and more scalable than what can be achieved
 * with `UVPoll`, especially on Windows.
 *
 * It is possible that poll handles occasionally signal that a file descriptor is readable
 * or writable even when it isn't. The user should therefore always be prepared to handle
 * EAGAIN or equivalent when it attempts to read from or write to the fd.
 *
 * It is not okay to have multiple active poll handles for the same socket, this can cause
 * libuv to busyloop or otherwise malfunction.
 *
 * The user should not close a file descriptor while it is being polled by an active poll
 * handle. This can cause the handle to report an error, but it might also start polling
 * another socket. However the fd can be safely closed immediately after a call to
 * uv_poll_stop() or uv_close().
 *
 * Note: On windows only sockets can be polled with poll handles. On Unix any file descriptor that would be accepted by poll(2) can be used.
 *
 * Note: On AIX, watching for disconnection is not supported.

/**
 * Signal handles implement Unix style signal handling on a per-event loop bases.
 *
 * UNIX signal handling on a per-event loop basis. The implementation is not
 * ultra efficient so don't go creating a million event loops with a million
 * signal watchers.
 *
 * Note to Linux users: `SIGRT0` and `SIGRT1` (signals 32 and 33) are used by the
 * NPTL pthreads library to manage threads. Installing watchers for those
 * signals will lead to unpredictable behavior and is strongly discouraged.
 * Future versions of libuv may simply reject them.
 *
 * Some signal support is available on `Windows`:
 *
 *   `SIGINT` is normally delivered when the user presses CTRL+C. However, like
 *   on Unix, it is not generated when terminal raw mode is enabled.
 *
 *   `SIGBREAK` is delivered when the user pressed CTRL+BREAK.
 *
 *   `SIGHUP` is generated when the user closes the console window. On `SIGHUP` the
 *   program is given approximately 10 seconds to perform cleanup. After that
 *   Windows will unconditionally terminate it.
 *
 *   `SIGWINCH` is raised whenever libuv detects that the console has been
 *   resized. `SIGWINCH` is emulated by libuv when the program uses an uv_tty_t
 *   handle to write to the console. `SIGWINCH` may not always be delivered in a
 *   timely manner; libuv will only detect size changes when the cursor is
 *   being moved. When a readable uv_tty_handle is used in raw mode, resizing
 *   the console buffer will also trigger a `SIGWINCH` signal.
 *
 * Watchers for other signals can be successfully created, but these signals
 * are never generated. These signals are: `SIGILL`, `SIGABRT`, `SIGFPE`, `SIGSEGV`,
 * `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL`.
 *
 * Note that calls to raise() or abort() to programmatically raise a signal are
 * not detected by libuv; these will not trigger a signal watcher.
